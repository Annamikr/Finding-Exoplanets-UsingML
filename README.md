# Finding-Exoplanets-UsingML
NASA had made a dataset available to the public consisting of exoplanet candidates found by the Kepler Space Telescope. Despite the telescope having retired in late 2018, there is luckily a dataset of 'objects of interest' published by NASA containing all confirmed and possible exoplanets observed by the mission. As of August 2022, 2,056 exoplanet candidates remain to be confirmed and 2,711 are now confirmed exoplanets. 
The purpose of this analysis is to build a model that predicts whether or not a planet is an exoplanet based on the features provided in the dataset. Finding new exoplanets is of great significance to the scietific community as the objective is to find Earth-like planets that could be habitable.
